          <strong>Kristiansund</strong> (historically spelled
          <em>Christianssund</em> and earlier named <em>Fosna</em>) is a
          municipality on the western coast of Norway in the Nordmøre district
          of Møre og Romsdal county. The administrative center of the
          municipality is the town of Kristiansund (established in 1742), which
          is the major town for the whole Nordmøre region. Other notable
          settlements in the municipality include the villages of Kvalvåg,
          Rensvik, and Nedre Frei.

          The 87-square-kilometre (34 sq mi) municipality is the 334th largest
          by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Kristiansund
          Municipality is the 53rd most populous municipality in Norway with a
          population of 24,404. The municipality's population density is 279.1
          inhabitants per square kilometre (723/sq mi) and its population has
          increased by 0.04% over the previous 10-year period.

          The municipality is named after the town of Kristiansund.
          Historically, it was spelled Christianssund. The first element of the
          name comes from the Danish-Norwegian King Christian VI who founded the
          town in 1742. The last element of the name is sund which means
          "strait" or "sound". The old name of the town/village (originally the
          island Kirkelandet) was Fosna or Fosen (Old Norse: fólgsn) which means
          "hiding place" (here 'hidden port'). It was also often named Lille
          Fosen ("the small Fosen") to distinguish it from the island Storfosna
          ("the big Fosen") in Ørland.
        </p>
        <p class="article-text hidden">
          Before 1877, the name was spelled <em>Christianssund</em>, from 1877
          to 1888 it was spelled <em>Kristianssund</em>, and since 1889 it has
          had its present spelling, <em>Kristiansund</em>.

        <p class="article-text hidden">
          Before the introduction of postal codes in Norway in 1968, it was easy
          to confuse the name Kristiansund with Kristiansand in the south. It
          was therefore obligatory to always add an N (for north) to
          Kristiansund (Kristiansund N) and an S (for south) to Kristiansand
          (Kristiansand S). This is pretty much still practiced and also occurs
          in some other contexts than postal addresses.

          The coat of arms was granted on 27 June 1742. The arms were granted by
          King Christian VI and are described as a silver or white river flowing
          from a cliff, with salmon swimming upwards on a blue background. The
          waterfall is most likely based on a misinterpretaion of the old name
          for the town Fosen, as it resembles the Norwegian word for
          "waterfall". A replica of the waterfall shown in the arms was
          eventually constructed in 1992 for the towns 250th anniversary.

          The municipality borders Smøla Municipality and Aure Municipality to
          the northeast, Tingvoll Municipality to the east, Gjemnes Municipality
          to the south, and Averøy Municipality to the southwest. The small Grip
          archipelago is located in the northwestern part of the municipality.
          The municipality is surrounded by the Freifjorden and Kvernesfjorden
          with the open sea to the northwest.

          The town of Kristiansund is built on four main islands, with many
          smaller islands. The island of Nordlandet ("North Land", humorously
          nicknamed Marokko), is the second largest island and the site of the
          local airport, Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget (IATA code: KSU).
          Kirklandet, third in size is made up of two areas Kirkelandet and
          Gomalandet. In the local dialect, Kirkelandet (the "Church Land") is
          pronounced "Kirklandet", without the middle e. The smallest island is
          Innlandet ("Innermost Land"; humorously, "Tahiti"). The largest island
          in the municipality is Frei which was part of the old Frei
          Municipality which was merged into Kristiansund on 1 January 2008. The
          highest point of the municipality is located on Frei island,
          Freikollen at a height of 629 metres (2,064 ft).

        <p class="article-text hidden">
          The islands of Grip, located northwest of Kristiansund are also a part
          of the municipality. Grip Municipality was Norway's smallest
          municipality, and also one of the most remote until it merged with
          Kristiansund in 1964. Today the island of Grip holds status as a
          deserted fishing village, but in the summer season it is a popular
          tourist attraction due to the very special location and architecture.
          Grip Stave Church, the second smallest stave church of Norway
          (Undredal Stave Church is smaller), is also located at Grip. It is
          also where Grip Lighthouse is located.

          Kristiansund includes the town of Kristiansund which is one of the
          most densely populated cities of Norway, having what is arguably the
          country's most urban small city centre, due to the relatively small
          size of the islands on which it is built and the very constricted
          central harbor/town area of Kirkelandet.
